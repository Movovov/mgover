        "text": "\n\n Depends a lot upon your playing style. Every gun is powerful if used appropriately.\n\n If you are someone who prefers to keep his distance from the enemy then my recommendation for you would be either M60 or Famas or AK(only with bipod).\n\n Many people are not comfortable with Famas as you have to keep on tapping. I personally find it a very devastating gun of the game.\n\n If you are someone who likes to handle the front. Then short range combat guns that are most supreme and devastating are:\n\n⚡ SPAS - Although the damage is less than M105 but the range and rate of fire is far superior.\n\n⚡ MP40 - Offers the fastest rate of fire, just be careful about the magazine clip while using it.\n\n⚡ M1014 - Although it is the slowest gun in the game, it is also the most powerful one. One point-blank clean hit and the opponent goes down.\n\nThen comes the legendary guns from the airdrops:\n\n⚡ Groza - Definitely the best AR gun in the game.\n\n⚡ AWM - For Sniper\n\n⚡ Dragunov -AR sniper which works better than SKS.\n\n⚡ Grenade Launcher - With one shot you can take out the whole squad but be careful when you miss or be cautious that you don’t blast it too close to yourself. It is a double-edged sword.",
